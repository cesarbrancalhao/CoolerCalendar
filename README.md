Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cesarbrancalhao/CoolerCalendar.git
```
Done! Good to go.

*__If you want to use it offline__ you'll need to download the Bootstrap and jQuery packages and update the imports on index.html.*


## <a name="start">How to use</a>

After the instalation is complete you will want to integrate the Ajax calls to your own endpoints and delete placeholders.js.<br>
Then if you're not offline, just open index.html.

From FullCalendar 1.6.4:

- Added forms to properly create and edit events.
- Added a help button explaining how events work.
- Changed style and fields used on the events.
- Patched problems with the events not being rendered on the correct places.
- Patched resizing and responsivity bugs.

- Add more types of events (situations) and filters for them.
